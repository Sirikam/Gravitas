        "q_list" = quiz_id + "q_list"
    request.session[quiz_id + "_score"] is current score.
    Best possible score is number of questions.

used by both user and anon:

    request.session['page_count'] is a counter used for displaying message
    every X number of pages

useful query sets:

    question.answer_set.all() is all the answers for question
    quiz.question_set.all() is all the questions in a quiz

To do:
        variable scores per question
        if a user does some questions as anon, then logs in, remove these
        questions from remaining q list for logged in user
        allow the page count before a message is shown to be set in admin
